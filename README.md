### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaziNafiulHassan/Smart-Trash-AI.git
   cd Smart-Trash-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy example files
   cp .env.example .env
   cp neo4j.env.example neo4j.env

   # Edit with your actual credentials (see Environment Setup section)
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## üîß Environment Setup

This project requires several environment variables to function properly. For security reasons, these are not included in the repository.

### Required Environment Files

1. **`.env`** - Main application environment variables
2. **`neo4j.env`** - Neo4j database credentials

### Configuration Details

**`.env`** requires:
- `VITE_NEO4J_URI` - Your Neo4j AuraDB connection URI
- `VITE_NEO4J_USERNAME` - Your Neo4j username
- `VITE_NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Your Neo4j password
- `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Your OpenRouter API key for LLM services
- `VITE_SITE_URL` - Your deployment URL
- `VITE_SITE_NAME` - Application name

**`neo4j.env`** requires:
- `NEO4J_URI` - Your Neo4j AuraDB connection URI
- `NEO4J_USERNAME` - Your Neo4j username
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Your Neo4j password
- `NEO4J_DATABASE` - Database name (usually 'neo4j')

### Security Notes
- Never commit `.env` or `neo4j.env` files to version control
- These files are automatically ignored by Git
- Use the `.example` files as templates for new deployments
